   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID:
   ```typescript

2. Click on your **"Portfolio Contact Form"**
3. View all submissions in the dashboard
4. Export submissions to CSV

### Email Inbox

All submissions are automatically sent to your email, so you don't need to check the Formspree dashboard constantly.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send message"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Invalid Form ID**: Double-check your Formspree endpoint URL
2. **Environment variable not loaded**: Restart your dev server
3. **Network issue**: Check your internet connection
4. **CORS issue**: Make sure you're using the correct Formspree endpoint

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Restart dev server
npm run dev

# Check environment variable
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT  # Mac/Linux
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT   # Windows PowerShell
```

### Form submits but no email received

1. **Check spam folder** in your email
2. **Verify email** in Formspree account settings
3. **Check Formspree dashboard** for submissions
4. **Email settings** might need to be configured

### Form endpoint returns 404

- Your form ID is incorrect
- Copy the exact endpoint from Formspree dashboard
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or typos
