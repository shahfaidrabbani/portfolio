## How to Add Your Project Images

1. **Save your screenshots** in this directory with these exact names:
   - `2048-game.png` - Screenshot of your 2048 game
   - `sorting-visualiser.png` - Screenshot of your sorting visualizer

2. **Recommended Image Specifications:**
   - Format: PNG or JPG
   - Dimensions: 800x400px (2:1 aspect ratio) - recommended
   - File size: < 500KB for optimal loading
   - Quality: High resolution for Retina displays

3. **Quick Tips:**
   - Take full-screen screenshots of your projects
   - Crop to show the most interesting part
   - Ensure good contrast and visibility
   - Use consistent styling across images

## Using the Screenshots You Provided

Based on the screenshots you shared:

### 2048 Game
- Save the 2048 game screenshot as: `2048-game.png`
- Shows the game grid with tiles and score

### Sorting Visualizer  
- Save the sorting visualizer screenshot as: `sorting-visualiser.png`
- Shows the bars/visualization with controls

## Automated Process

You can simply:
1. Take screenshots of both projects
2. Rename them to match the names above
3. Drop them into this `public/projects/` folder
4. The portfolio will automatically display them!

If the images don't load, the portfolio will fall back to gradient placeholders with the first letter.
