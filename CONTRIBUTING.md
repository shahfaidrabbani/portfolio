## Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component and prop names

### Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utilities
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Test on multiple screen sizes

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Hero.tsx`, `ContactForm.tsx`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `fetchData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_WIDTH`, `API_URL`)
- **Files**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

   ```

4. **Run production build**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

Before submitting a PR:
- [ ] Test in development mode
- [ ] Test production build
- [ ] Check for console errors
